## What is DassFlow ?

**DassFlow** ***(Data Assimilation for Free Surface Flows)*** denotes a set of computational codes aiming at modeling free surface geophysical flows with data assimilation capabilities. These flows can be **water-rivers flows** *(Newtonian rheology)* but also **ice-glaciers flows** *(power-laws rheology)* or **lavas, muds flows[^1]** etc *(based on Herschel-Bulskley rheology laws)*. 
The dynamics flow models rely, mainly but not only, on the **Shallow Water systems** *(depth-integrated equations, long-wave assumption)*.   

[^1]: These features are yet to be implemented in future releases of DassFlow.

Two code versions are available:  
{{% button href="#dassflow1d" %}}**DassFlow1D**{{% /button %}}: networks of 1D river flow models.  
{{% button href="#dassflow2d" %}}**DassFlow2D**{{% /button %}}: accurate and robust 2D flows with wet-dry front dynamics; affordable over river networks with a 1D-like 2D approach *(see Fig.)*; spatialized modeling of hydrological source terms and boundary conditions.

The basic technologies of both codes are described in the [Shared technologies for all codes](/codes_presentation/pres_shared_tech) page.

## DassFlow1D
#### What does it include ?
- The **1D Shallow Water system** *(Saint-Venantâ€™s equations)* in variables (S,Q)(x,t).
- The **Diffusive Wave equation** *(the standard one and an original two-scales one)*.
- **Multi-branches** *(rivers network)*.
- **Data Assimilation** capabilities (variational or not) from **multi-source** / multi-nature data.
- The numerical schemes are: the classical **Preissmann FD scheme** or potentially **FV schemes**.
- Documentations, benchmarks *(analytical, toys, real data)*. 
- Global Sensitivity Analyses / UQ are quite easy to implement by interfacing with *e.g. OpenTurns library.*
- An additional original flow model dedicated to spatial hydrology is available: a **low-Froude algebraic model**.  

#### Key applications
- 1D river flows, potentially network.
- "Effective cross-sections" inference.
- Assimilation of multi-source data.
- Spatial hydrology: see {{% button href="/codes_presentation/pres_hivdi" target="_self" %}}the HiVDI algorithm{{% /button %}}, which enables to estimate rivers discharge at global scale from SWOT measurements.

## DassFlow2D
#### What does it include ?
- The **2D Shallow Water system in variables (h,qx,qy)** solved by accurate FV schemes *(1st order or actual 2nd order)*. Robust treatment of wet-dry front dynamics.
- A capability to locally **degenerate the 2D model into a 1D-like model** (therefore much less CPU-time consuming).
This enables to build up e.g. multiple branches 1D-like models with 2D zooms at the branches junction, or in highest-interest areas, or in inundations areas.  
- **Various Boundary Conditions** enable to tackle real-world problems.
- The **GR4 hydrological model** *(developed by L. Santos and G. Thirel from INRAe, HYCAR Research Unit)* is a lumped hydrological model implemented in a semi-distributed manner in DassFLow2D.
This enables to perform hydrological calibration via hydraulic information feedback in a sequential coupling GR4 - Shallow Water 2D.  
To consider a fully distributed hydrological model, please use {{% button href="/codes_presentation/pres_smash" target="_blank" %}}SMASH{{% /button %}}.  
- The **corresponding adjoint code** and a complete **4D-var optimization process** *(see the {{% button href="/codes_presentation/pres_shared_tech" target="_blank" %}}Shared technologies{{% /button %}} page)*. 
- Parallel computations (MPI Fortran).
- **Assimilation** of multi-source data.
- **Documentations**.
- **Benchmarks** *(analytical, toys, real data cases)*. 
- An easy use of **Python libraries** such as **deep learning, signal processing and statistics libraries** since the Fortran computational kernel code is **wrapped in Python** *(see the {{% button href="/codes_presentation/pres_shared_tech" target="_blank" %}}Shared technologies{{% /button %}} page)*.
- A **Reduced Order Model (ROMs)** of DassFlow2D is in progress.

#### Key applications
- **Rivers network dynamics** with local zooms, *e.g. in inundation areas (integrated 1D-2D flow solvers)*.  
- **Flood plain dynamics** with wet-dry fronts.  
- **Lava / mud flows** (Herschel-Bulckley rheology).
