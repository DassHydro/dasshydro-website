## What is DassHydro ?
**DassHydro** denotes the name of the code sequentially coupling {{% button href="/codes_presentation/pres_smash" target="_self" %}}SMASH{{% /button %}} and {{% button href="/codes_presentation/pres_dassflow/#dassflow2d" target="_self" %}}DassFlow2D{{% /button %}}. 

DassHydro enables complete simulations **from rainfall to discharge and inundation dynamics** *(rainfall-runoff hydraulics)*.  

As a consequence, DassHydro provides a quite complete computational code dedicated to **hydrology (floods, inundations)**.  

DassHydro inherits from all capabilities of DassFlow2D and SMASH, in particular of the **Data Assimilation** capabilities.
