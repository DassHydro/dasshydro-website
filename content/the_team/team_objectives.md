description: MathHydroNum, a French multidisciplinary research team focusing on the modeling and numerical estimations of water fluxes.
---
**MathHydroNum** denotes a French **multidisciplinary research project-team** offering expertise in numerical hydrology and the software platform
[DassHydro](http://github.com/DassHydro) *(Data Assimilation in Hydrology)* dedicated to numerical modeling of surface hydrodynamics and hydrology.

The team brings together expertise in computational sciences, hydrology, hydraulics, mathematical models and methods, inverse problems, statistical inference, sensitivity analysis, data assimilation, reduced models, and hybrid physically informed AI models.

The objectives of MathHydroNum are to design new generation models, numerical methods, algorithms, and computational softwares that address scientific challenges in the following areas:
- Numerical simulations of **floods and inundations**.
- **Spatial hydrology**, both at the global scale and regional scales, based on spatial observations (CNES, ESA, NASA etc missions),

### Current research areas
- Multi-scale flexible hydrological-hydraulic modeling.  
- Multi-source data assimilation.  
- Model reduction in hydraulics and hydrology.  
- Hybrid physically-informed neural networks.  DassHydro

a computational software modeling rainfall to discharge & inundation dynamics (rainfall-runoff hydraulics).
- Hybrid deterministic stochastic data assimilation algorithms.  

### Algorithmic products
- Numerical models for flood propagation at the watershed scale.
- River discharge estimation at both planetary and regional scales.
- Rivers bathymetry profiles estimation.
- Hydrology-hydraulics models coupling.
- Non-linear rheology parameters estimation.
