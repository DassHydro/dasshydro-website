	"content": "Codes presentation DassFlow is the code simulating river dynamics either based on the 2D Shallow Water system (2D SW), DassFlow 2D code, or on the 1D Saint-Venant system (1D SW), DassFlow1D code.\nSMASH is the code simulating the hydrology (spatially distributed model) at watershed scale.\nDassHydro is the code integrating both codes, which are weakly coupled in the way SMASH - DassFlow 2D.\nCodes languages and architecture The three codes ( DassFlow2D , DassFlow1D and SMASH ) have been built up following the same spirit and technologies.\nThe computational kernel codes are written in Fortran 90 with parallel capabilities for DassFlow2D and SMASH (useless feature for DassFlow1D).\nThe Fortran kernel codes are wrapped in Python using f90wrap [Kermode, 2020].\nThis enables to use numerous Python libraries on top of the physics-based computations such as pre or post-processing of the computed fields or data, but also Machine Learning, wavelet basis etc.\nUQ libraries such as OpenTurns can be easily jointly employed too.\nLinear systems are solved using MUMPS or NumPy libraries.\nEach code version includes a forward code, the corresponding adjoint code generated by performing the automatic differentiation tool Tapenade [Hascoet and Pascual, 2013].\nEach code version includes various optimization algorithms and estimation approaches (e.g. Bayesian analysis).\nThe typical optimization algorithms are (non exhaustive list):\nLimited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno Bounded (L-BFGS-B): Quasi-Newton methods for bounded optimization [Zhu et al., 1994]. Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM): Adaptive learning rates with momentum for fast convergence [Kingma and Ba, 2014]. The complete optimization processes provide parameters identification, reduced uncertainties, calibrated model(s).\nVDA formulations are based on priors: optimization starting points and covariances operators (probabilistic priors).\nClassical and original covariances operators can be considered.\nDifferent regularization terms can be considered.\nThe estimation strategies can partially rely on Machine Learning techniques by employing e.g. Feed-Forward Neural Networks, LSTM (PyTorch library).\nEach code is interfaced with few pre and post-processors enabling to tackle large scale real-world datasets: GIS libraries, mesh generators, visualization tools.\nKeywords: Python-wrapped computational codes; Fortran computational kernels (utilizing MPI for parallelization); adjoint codes; optimization libraries; pre and post-processing Python interfaces; mesh procedures for models coupling.

	"description": "DassFlow (Data Assimilation for Free Surface Flows), a set of computational codes aiming at modeling free surface geophysical flows with data assimilation capabilities.",
	"content": "\nFine scale 1D hydraulic model with hydrological inflows of the Negro River in the Amazon basin built from multi-satellite and in situ data. From [Pujol et al. 2020, JoH] What is DassFlow ? DassFlow (Data Assimilation for Free Surface Flows) denotes a set of computational codes aiming at modeling free surface geophysical flows with data assimilation capabilities. These flows can be water-rivers flows (Newtonian rheology) but also ice-glaciers flows (power-laws rheology) or lavas, muds flows1 etc (based on Herschel-Bulskley rheology laws). The dynamics flow models rely, mainly but not only, on the Shallow Water systems (depth-integrated equations, long-wave assumption).\nTwo code versions are available:\nDassFlow1D : networks of 1D river flow models.\nDassFlow2D : accurate and robust 2D flows with wet-dry front dynamics; affordable over river networks with a 1D-like 2D approach (see Fig.); spatialized modeling of hydrological source terms and boundary conditions.\nThe basic technologies of both codes are described in the Shared technologies for all codes page.\nDassFlow1D What does it include ? The 1D Shallow Water system (Saint-Venant’s equations) in variables (S,Q)(x,t). The Diffusive Wave equation (the standard one and an original two-scales one). Multi-branches (rivers network). Data Assimilation capabilities (variational or not) from multi-source / multi-nature data. The numerical schemes are: the classical Preissmann FD scheme or potentially FV schemes. Documentations, benchmarks (analytical, toys, real data). Global Sensitivity Analyses / UQ are quite easy to implement by interfacing with e.g. OpenTurns library. An additional original flow model dedicated to spatial hydrology is available: a low-Froude algebraic model. Key applications 1D river flows, potentially network. \u0026ldquo;Effective cross-sections\u0026rdquo; inference. Assimilation of multi-source data. Spatial hydrology: see the HiVDI algorithm , which enables to estimate rivers discharge at global scale from SWOT measurements. Test cases and real-world applications of HiVDI (based on DassFlow1D)\nDassFlow2D What does it include ? The 2D Shallow Water system in variables (h,qx,qy) solved by accurate FV schemes (1st order or actual 2nd order). Robust treatment of wet-dry front dynamics. A capability to locally degenerate the 2D model into a 1D-like model (therefore much less CPU-time consuming). This enables to build up e.g. multiple branches 1D-like models with 2D zooms at the branches junction, or in highest-interest areas, or in inundations areas. Various Boundary Conditions enable to tackle real-world problems. The GR4 hydrological model (developed by L. Santos and G. Thirel from INRAe, HYCAR Research Unit) is a lumped hydrological model implemented in a semi-distributed manner in DassFLow2D. This enables to perform hydrological calibration via hydraulic information feedback in a sequential coupling GR4 - Shallow Water 2D.\nTo consider a fully distributed hydrological model, please use SMASH . The corresponding adjoint code and a complete 4D-var optimization process (see the Shared technologies page). Parallel computations (MPI Fortran). Assimilation of multi-source data. Documentations. Benchmarks (analytical, toys, real data cases). An easy use of Python libraries such as deep learning, signal processing and statistics libraries since the Fortran computational kernel code is wrapped in Python (see the Shared technologies page). A Reduced Order Model (ROMs) of DassFlow2D is in progress. Key applications Rivers network dynamics with local zooms, e.g. in inundation areas (integrated 1D-2D flow solvers). Flood plain dynamics with wet-dry fronts. Lava / mud flows (Herschel-Bulckley rheology). Full 2D computations of Garonne river (Toulouse-Castelsarrasin portion, southern France). 87O K cells (MPI computations both for the direct and the adjoint codes). Datasets provided by D.

SMASH Spatially distributed Modeling and Assimilation for Hydrology denotes a computational code aiming at simulating discharge hydrographs and hydrological states at any spatial location within a basin and reproduce the hydrological response of contrasted catchments. It contains several hydrological operators and flexible model structures with data assimilation and sensitivity analysis algorithms. The code is designed both for operational forecasting of floods and low flows, and can take advantage of spatially distributed meteorological forcings, physiographic data and hydrometric observations.\nThe code is available on GitHub and its SPHINX documentation on the Documentation page.\nThe basic technologies of the code are described in the Shared technologies for all codes page.\nWhat does it include ? SMASH is a modular platform that contains conceptual representations and numerical approximations of dominant hydrological processes while aiming to maintain a relative parsimony. It also contains several algorithms for pre and post-processing, signal analysis, model optimization and data assimilation over large datasets. It originally enables to use variational data assimilation and hybrid methods based on statistical/machine learning approaches. SMASH enables to work at multiple spatio-temporal resolutions, with heterogeneous data in nature and sampling.\nMultiple flow operators can be combined to describe spatialized hydrological processes at pixel scale, including runoff production, and flow routing towards catchment outlet. These operators are based on effective and widely used conceptualizations and models used in the hydrology community.\nGR-like (cf. [Perrin et al. 2003], Brief history of GR models). VIC-like (cf. [Liang et al. 1994], VIC overview). Lateral flow routing with conceptual models or Kinematic wave. Several optimization algorithms can be considered: see Shared technologies for all codes . Different estimation methods have been investigated, for example:\nBayesian-like parameter estimation algorithm [Huynh et al. in prep] following [Chelil et al. 2022]. Variational Data Assimilation (VDA) [Jay-Allemand et al. 2020] and Hybrid Variational Data Assimilation Parameter regionalization (HVDA-PR) [Huynh et al. 2023a]. Bayesian-Guided Multivariate Regression [Huynh et al. 2023b], Bayesian estimation tools that can be used alone or with HD algorithms. Rainfall moments and Hydrological signatures can be computed at multiple scales ; signatures can be used in optimization [Huynh et al. 2022]. LSTM algorithms applicable to model inputs-outputs [Huynh et al. in prep] after [Hashemi et al. 2021].
